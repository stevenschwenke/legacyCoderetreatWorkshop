This is a full-day workshop for developers who want to improve in handling legacy Java code. 

## Draft for agenda
### 9 - 10
- introduction of facilitators and participants:
    - Number of years worked in what can be conceived as "legacy code"?
    - Name one lesson learned from past experiences with legacy code!
    - State one goal for you for today - what do you want to think / feel / know at the end of the day?
- explain coderetreat format
    - 45 mins pair programming
    - 15 mins retrospective
    - 15 mins pause
- finding first pairs
    
### 10 - 10:30 Quick start: Getting to know ugly trivia game 
- just toy around with the ugly trivia game

### 14:30 - 15:30 Mikado method
- at the beginning: explain the technique quickly

- Falk: Do you have a good codebase for this? buggyAndUgly is not that well suited.

### 15:45 - 16:45 Applying to your own code OR one more topic
- participants decide if they want to apply learned methods on own code (or the codebases provided) or learn another method
